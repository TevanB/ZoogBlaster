# ZoogBlaster
Java Game Made with intensive use of Object Oriented Programming, Java Graphical User Interface, and Pathing Algorithm Designed after Genetic Algorithms

All code was created from scratch.

This game used Java GUI elements to give a user interface and make it launch into an actual game.

Built into this game is a "sandbox mode" like sidebar (using Java GUI) to alter some variables such as character speed mid game.

Instructions on how to play:
- Player Movement: (W = Move Up, A = Move Left, S = Move Down, D = Move Right)
- Press Shift to toggle running
- Press Space while on a chest to collect it
- Use Arrow Keys to shoot a Spray Projectile in the key's direction

Genetic Algorithm inspired portion of the code can be seen in the MonsterDNA.java and Monster.java files under the src folder.
